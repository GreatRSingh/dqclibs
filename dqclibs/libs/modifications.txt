This lib directory contains libraries from PySCF. The modifications made:
* Modifying CMakeLists.txt so only include gto, np_helper, vhf, and pbc
* In the code generator, added:
  * Higher derivatives for nabla (nabla^2, nabla^3)
  * Laplacian (nabla dot nabla) and the derivatives of it
* Modified CMakeLists.txt to have (OpenMP_C_FLAGS " ") if not setting option USE_OPENMP to ON
  * Turn on OpenMP with -DUSE_OPENMP=ON
